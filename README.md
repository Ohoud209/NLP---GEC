# NLP---GEC
A Comparative Review of Grammatical Error Correction Techniques 


This project is devoted to the use of the basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods (identifying and processing textual data). The model is based on a typical NLP 
pipeline that comprises of data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. Different representations and methods of learning are discussed to learn 
how the different techniques can influence model performance. The purpose is to develop a productive NLP model with the understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of mainstream 
NLP techniques.
Based on the results of the experiment, the models applied demonstrate acceptable performance in the chosen NLP task. The TF-IDF feature based representation was the traditional 
representation that offered a high and stable baseline. The following performance was achieved following the resultant careful preprocessing, such as tokenization, stopword removal, 
and normalization. The last model showed consistent accuracy and equal precision and recall which implies good generalization on unseen data.

Similar experiments have shown that performance is also different with respect to the feature selection and parameters. Simple models worked effectively in repetitive and better 
structured textual configurations whereas the complex tables was a challenge. On the whole, the assessment measures prove that the recommended strategy works with the specified data.

The findings demonstrate the relevance of quality preprocess and proper feature selection in NLP tasks. Majority of the classification 
mistakes were associated with obscure terms, contextual relationships or with the extreme occurrence of words that are challenging to represent with the conventional structures. It 
implies that although classical methods of NLP are effective and practical, they can have difficulties with more in-depth semantic analysis.

These limitations do not prevent the project showing that properly designed NLP pipelines can bring significant and valid results. 
Future work may involve applying contextual embeddings or transformer-based models to achieve more semantic complexity across a wider range of being able to handle challenging 
linguistic examples.
